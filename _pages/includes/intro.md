# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a first year PhD. candidate in [Computer Vision at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/computer-vision-department/). I completed my MS in [Machine Learning at MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/machine-learning-department/) under the supervision of Dr. [Karthik Nandakumar](https://www.sprintai.org/nkarthik) and Dr. [Mohammad Yaqub](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9dfn5GkAAAAJ).
<!-- I completed my bachelor's degree in [Computer Science at Aligarh Muslim University](https://www.amu.ac.in/department/computer-science) in July 2022, advised by Dr. [Faisal Anwer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-VW0mAAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Mohammad Nadeem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yaEgXYMAAAAJ&hl=en). -->


<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

<!-- **Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data privacy, data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data Privacy: Membership Inference Attack
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning -->

**Research Interests**: I am mainly interested in model-centric AI and data-centric machine learning, including data privacy, model robustness, domain generalization, and healthcare related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Currently, I am securing large vision models (LVMs) so that they can be relied upon for effective real-world deployment. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Knowledge Distillation, Distribution Alignment
- Data Security: Adversarial Training, Model Extraction Attack
- Domain Generalization: Ensembling, Zero-shot Generalization 
- Healthcare-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning

ü§î For my MS thesis, I explored the aspects of domain generalization at test time, without any additional model training or fine-tuning, associated with in-domain, out-domain, and cross-domain data, particularly zero-shot generalization of large vision models like CLIP.

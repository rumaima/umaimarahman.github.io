# üë©‚Äçüî¨ About Me

Hi there! I am a final-year PhD candidate in [Computer Vision at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/computer-vision-department/), working under the guidance of Dr. [Dwarikanath Mahapatra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j5K7HPoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Mohammad Yaqub](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9dfn5GkAAAAJ). My research focuses on developing robust vision-language models (VLMs) for healthcare, with a specific interest in domain generalization and out-of-distribution learning.

Previously, I interned at the [Inception Institute of AI (G42)](https://www.g42.ai/), where I developed adaptive solutions for healthcare applications using VLMs and built a Gradio web app for generating customized medical summaries. I have also worked with Omdena, IBM, and Bose Institute in various roles, contributing to machine learning model development, automation, and bioinformatics research.

**Research Interests**: I am passionate about improving the real-world applicability of AI in healthcare. My work spans:
- **OOD Generalization**: Out-of-distribution generalisation through Disentangled representation learning and multi-modal adaptation.
- **Model Robustness**: Test-time adaptation and handling distributional shifts.
- **Healthcare Applications**: Medical image classification, segmentation, and decision support systems.
- **Efficient AI**: Techniques for leveraging lightweight and scalable AI models.

I have several peer-reviewed publications, including works presented at MLHC, EUVIP. Beyond academics, I have partcipated in multiple innovation and AI hackathons, demonstrating my drive for creating impactful solutions.

Feel free to connect with me as I strive to advance healthcare through innovative AI!
